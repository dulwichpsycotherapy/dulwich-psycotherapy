    				<h3>What if I cannot afford therapy?</h3>
    					<p class="mdownf">Unfortunately Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy is not widely available in an equitable manner in the NHS, but it is always worth asking your GP for a referral for NHS Psychotherapy.</p>
    					<p class="mdownf">Most General Practitioners also have Counsellors who can offer short-term therapy usually up to six sessions.</p>

    					<h3>Do you offer CBT?</h3>
    		      <p class="mdownf">Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is increasingly being recommended to patients in the NHS. This can be an effective method of treatment in the short - term, but it is important to look at the longer - term evidence for effectiveness of any psychotherapy treatment whether psychoanalytic or cognitive.</p>
    					<p class="mdownf">Contact the <a href="http://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/">UKCP</a> or <a href="https://www.bpc.org.uk/">BPC</a> or <a href="https://www.bacp.co.uk/">BACP</a> for further information and other types of therapy.</p>

    		      <h3 class="altcoldark mdownf mup">Is it safe to see a Trainee Psychotherapist?</h3>
    		      <p class="mdownf">All of BPC trainings require trainees, who do not already have a mental health qualification for example, psychiatrists, doctors, nurses, psychologists or social workers, to demonstrate sufficient clinical experience.</p>
    		      <p class="mdownf">Students are also supervised weekly by experienced training psychotherapists.</p>

    			  <h3 class="altcoldark mdownf mup">Can I use My Health Insurance cover? </h3>

    			  <p class="mdownf">This depends on the nature of your policy.</p>
    			  <p class="mdownf">You should check with your provider to see whether psychotherapy  sessions will be covered, how many sessions can be included and if there are any other restrictions. I am eligible and do register with the major health insurance providers as required.</p>
    			  <p class="mdownf">Please ask first, as you will be responsible for any payments, not the third party.</p>

    			  <h3 class="altcoldark mdownf">How can I choose a therapist I can trust?</h3>

    			  <p class="mdownf">This is a very important question as there are a vast number of Counsellors and Psychotherapists who advertise their services and currently no law that prevents anyone from calling themselves  a Psychotherapist or Counsellor.</p>
    			  <p class="mdownf">So how do you know if your therapist is right for you?  Does the Psychotherapist provide a designated and private room for sessions, and are you treated with respect? Does the therapist maintain boundaries and give you time and an opportunity to ask appropriate questions? </p>
    			  <p>Alternatively does the therapist make inappropriate self-disclosures or ask intrusive questions, behave in a seductive manner or make sexual advances? If this occurs you can seek advice from your GP and /or the therapistâ€™s registration body.</p>
    			  <p>The most important decision is based on how you feel when you meet the Psychotherapist or Counsellor for the first time. Trust your intuition and check that the Practioner is registered or whether they have a substantive paid post or is it rather voluntary (sometimes called honorary or trainee) post in the NHS.</p>
    				<p>Certainly at the initial assessment meeting with your therapist you should begin to get a sense of what you want from therapy aside from your presenting problem(s) or unhappiness: some sort of formulation that makes sense to you. This should always be a joint enterprise and you should be allowed to ask appropriate questions. Forget the caricature of the therapist who sits in silence for fifty minutes and replies to every question with "what do you think?" This may be appropriate at times but should rarely happy these days especially in an initial assessment.</p>
