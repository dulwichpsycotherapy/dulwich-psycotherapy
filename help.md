				<h1>Where can I Help?</h1>
				<blockquote>We live in a society where we want a quick fix to most of our problems, be that drugs or mind - altering
				and shorter cognitive therapies.
				<br>Yet, relationship difficulties often have longer-term roots stemming from early childhood patterns or
				relationships with significant people in our lives, including parents, siblings and partners.</blockquote>

							<h3>Confidential, Private Setting</h3>

							<p>The therapist offers a confidential and private setting which facilitates a process whereby unconscious
							patterns of the person’s inner world are reflected in the relationship with the therapist.
							Therapy can be brief, long-term or short-term, depending on individual needs.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
							<h3>Process</h3>

							<p>Psychotherapists also have to be honest about their own weaknesses and areas for growth. The process
							 helps people gradually identify these patterns and, in becoming conscious of them, to develop the
							 capacity to understand and change them. The aim is for new and better resolution of longstanding
							 conflicts, leading to a greater capacity for satisfaction in relationships, work and social life.</p>
